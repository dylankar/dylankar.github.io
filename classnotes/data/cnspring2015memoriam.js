{"SUBMISSION_DATE":"7/7/14","FIRST_NAME":"Travis Lee","LAST_NAME":"Sowders","PROGRAM":"FEMBA","CLASS_YEAR":2009,"CLASS_NOTE":"Travis Lee Sowders, age 39, of West Hollywood, CA died Wednesday, June 11, 2014 due to injuries sustained in an automobile accident in Los Angeles, CA. He was an extraordinary partner, son, brother, uncle, cousin, friend, and all around bon vivant. Travis had an innate ability to make you feel that you were the only person in the world he cared about while engaging you in conversation. With movie star looks, sparkling blue eyes, and the most engaging smile, he could disarm even the most cynical and most clamored to be considered his friend and confidant. Born in Corbin, Kentucky on March 12, 1975 to a family that adored and loved him, he was molded early on with values he learned in the small town of Barbourville, KY. He was a graduate of Knox Central High School. His family life was the foundation for who he would become later in life. His brilliance got him into Princeton University where he fine-tuned his wit, charismatic charm, and life-long passion for politics. He had an amazing capacity to know the details of every member of Congress and spent many a night quizzing his friends about the inner workings of Congress. He was a natural born politician. Later in 2009, he also received his MBA from UCLA Anderson in Los Angeles. But it was one fateful Memorial Day weekend in 2001 that set Travis’s life on a path of love, happiness, adventure, and joy when he met his domestic partner, Rob Six. They didn’t know anything about each other that night, but the pull of destiny was strong and that one night led to 13 beautiful years. They grew up together, shared in their love for their dog Sofie, traveled the world, discovered amazing wines and restaurants, created homes in Washington DC, New York City and Los Angeles, and built beautiful friendships on each adventure they shared. They lived a full and beautiful life with one another. Travis is survived by his partner Rob Six of West Hollywood, CA; parents, Ancil and Lynn Sowders of Barbourville, KY; his sister, Synthia Sowders of Barbourville, KY; his nieces, Lillian and Audra Partin; many dear and beloved aunts and uncles; friends from around the world; and his beloved dog companion, Sofie. He was preceded in death by his maternal grandparents, William and Cordia Graham and his paternal grandparents, Bev and Betty Sowders.","PHOTO_1":"http://www.anderson.ucla.edu/lib/email/alumni/web/classnotes/img/TravisLeeSowders.jpg","PHOTO_1_CAPTION":"Travis Lee Sowders","PHOTO_2":null,"PHOTO_2_CAPTION":null}]
